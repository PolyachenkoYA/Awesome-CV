\letterintrosection

\lettersection{About Me}
My name is Yury Polyachenko. I am a 3rd-year undergraduate student at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT). I have been interested in computer simulations since the 9th grade of high school, where I was studying spiral structure formation in galaxies for 3 years, both implementing C++ and Matlab code and running simulations using the Agama package. Later on, as a freshman at MIPT, I joined Prof. Genri Norman's lab of Computational Condensed Matter Physics and Life Systems. As my 1st project in this lab, I created a molecular dynamics (MD) package from scratch with an ultimate goal to test and improve Kinetic Molecular Theory equations. 

Now, I have been working with Prof. Norman and Prof. Timofeev for over 2 years. I am currently investigating a discontinuity phenomenon in a stable-metastable phase transition in the Lennard-Jones system using LAMMPS and Matlab. I discovered a property that exhibits an anticipated disruption at the transition point, therefore enables the detection of a phase transition as a possible application. Throughout my research, I delivered 2 oral reports at Russian national conferences, and we are currently preparing our results for submission to PRL.

Last summer I attended CECAM SISSA MD school, where I had an opportunity to strengthen my knowledge in enhanced sampling, Monte Carlo, simulation reversibility, polymer and protein dynamics. I was immensely excited by Prof. Mark Tuckerman's lectures on applying ML and MD to the drug design. Being spurred, in the fall term, I completed several courses on MD, HPC and ML at MIPT, being ranked as the top 1 in my class. In the forthcoming semester, I am having the "Soft Matter Physics" course, which will focus on a membrane and biomolecules dynamics. I believe EPFL, being a very applied-oriented university and a major player in CECAM, provides an excellent opportunity to challenge myself with non-trivial problems related to my background and interests this summer. Specifically, I am interested in joining several scientific groups in which I believe I can fully realize my scientific potential.

\newpage

\lettersection{Laboratory for Biomolecular Modeling}
I am quite familiar with Molecular simulation, HPC, and computational physics in general. All of them are mentioned as relevant for the lab in the "how to apply" section. On the physical side of the topic - I think my forthcoming "Soft matter physics" course will fit the lab's field perfectly. Thus, speaking of master's and bachelor projects offered in the lab, I am specifically interested in integrative modeling, membrane biophysics and bio-inspired nanosensors.

\lettersection{Laboratory of Protein and Cell Engineering}
In SISSA, I got acquainted with protein and drug design, which also turned out to be very fascinating topics for me. I was very impressed by the truly physical ideas used there. Additionally, I believe "Soft matter physics" course will be very useful for this lab. Thus the left side of the main scheme on the Research page of the lab really bewitched me. I would name "Computational Biology" and "Protein Design" as my top picks from ones presented in the research page of the lab.

\lettersection{Laboratory of the Physics of Biological Systems}
First of all - on the Undergraduate sections of the Open Positions page of the lab it is stated that if I am an undergrad with string programming skills and interest in biophysical research, they want me in. I believe myself to fit the description. Moreover, additionally to all biology-related areas of research I have already mentioned in this letter, I can see Casimir Forces in many recent publications of the lab. I completed the 1st part of the Landau-Lifshitz quantum mechanics course with 10/10 final grade and I will finish it by the summer. Thus, I think I will be capable to work on that subject by that time.

To sum up, I am immensely interested in joining EPFL as a summer intern. The program would provide an excellent opportunity to develop both professionally and academically, which I believe would prove critical when applying for a doctoral degree program at EPFL. I thank you for your time, and I sincerely appreciate your consideration of my application. Please do not hesitate to contact me at  \href{mailto:polyachenko.yua@phystech.edu}{polyachenko.yua@phystech.edu}.
