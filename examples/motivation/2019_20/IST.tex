\letterintrosection

\lettersection{About Me}
My name is Yury Polyachenko. I am a 3rd-year undergraduate student at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT). As a freshman at MIPT, I joined Prof. Genri Norman’s lab of Computational Condensed Matter Physics and Life Systems. Now, I have been working with Prof. Norman for over 2 years. I am currently investigating a discontinuity phenomenon in a stable-metastable phase transition in the Lennard-Jones system using LAMMPS and Matlab. I have completed courses on HPC, molecular dynamics (MD), and machine learning. Next semester I am having a life-science course “soft matter physics”. Last summer I attended CECAM SISSA MD school, where I studied enhanced sampling, Monte Carlo, simulation reversibility, polymer and protein dynamics, and application of ML and MD in drug design. Overall, I am trying to broaden my horizons as much as possible. That is why I think a very multidisciplinary ISTernship program provides an excellent opportunity to challenge myself with new problems. Therefore, I am interested in joining several scientific groups in which I believe I can fully realize my scientific potential. 

\lettersection{Physical principles in Biological systems}
I think my background fits the lab’s topics remarkably well. I already have a solid CS and physical qualifications. I am sure the “soft matter physics” course, which will focus on tissue and membrane dynamics, will give me a good start for developing my bio-skills and knowledge. Therefore I find Hanezzo’s lab to be a great place for me to dig deeper into the fusion of physics and life science. Specifically, I am interested in the project about deriving complex architecture from simple principles because the emergence of complexity from a simple set of rules was the very thing that brought me to physical simulation in the first place.

\lettersection{Systems and synthetic biology of genetic networks}
Molecular biology, for which most of my skills are relevant, is one of the main subjects of the lab. Protein dynamics I got acquainted at SISSA truly intrigued me, and it is a vital process in cell-biology studied in the lab.

\lettersection{Computer graphics and physics simulation}
I have to admit that I have some computer-gaming experience so that I will be invested in the issues solved in every way possible (even not purely scientific). Aside from the mentioned CS skills, I completed a year-long ODE course, and I will finish a year-long PDE course by the summer. Thus I will have all the primary skills stated in the Current Projects section of the lab’s page.

\end{cvletter}

To sum up, I am incredibly interested in joining ISTernship as a summer intern. The program would provide an excellent opportunity to develop both professionally and academically, which I believe would prove critical when applying for a doctoral degree program at IST Austria University. I thank you for your time, and I sincerely appreciate your consideration of my application. Please do not hesitate to contact me at \href{mailto:polyachenko.yua@phystech.edu}{polyachenko.yua@phystech.edu}.
