\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{Laboratory for Biomolecular Modeling}
I am quite familiar with Molecular simulation, HPC, and computational physics in general. All of them are mentioned as relevant for the lab in the "how to apply" section. On the physical side of the topic - I think my forthcoming "Soft matter physics" course will fit the lab's field perfectly. Thus, speaking of master's and bachelor projects offered in the lab, I am specifically interested in integrative modeling, membrane biophysics and bio-inspired nanosensors.

\lettersection{Laboratory of Protein and Cell Engineering}
In SISSA, I got acquainted with protein and drug design, which also turned out to be very fascinating topics for me. I was very impressed by the truly physical ideas used there. Additionally, I believe "Soft matter physics" course will be very useful for this lab. Thus the left side of the main scheme on the Research page of the lab really bewitched me. I would name "Computational Biology" and "Protein Design" as my top picks from ones presented in the research page of the lab.

\lettersection{Laboratory of the Physics of Biological Systems}
First of all - on the Undergraduate sections of the Open Positions page of the lab it is stated that if I am an undergrad with string programming skills and interest in biophysical research, they want me in. I believe myself to fit the description. Moreover, additionally to all biology-related areas of research I have already mentioned in this letter, I can see Casimir Forces in many recent publications of the lab. I completed the 1st part of the Landau-Lifshitz quantum mechanics course with 10/10 final grade and I will finish it by the summer. Thus, I think I will be capable to work on that subject by that time.
