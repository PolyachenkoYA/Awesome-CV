\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{Laboratory of Molecular Simulation}
This lab offers many exciting projects, yet the one that intrigues me the most is the <<Self-diffusion from a potential energy field>> project since it is closely related to my research experience. My first educational project on MD was about self-diffusion. So I was excited to learn how this lab's members pointed out ways to use TuTraSt for real-world applications such as, e.g., ion batteries and even for a very general and fundamental problem of studying chemical bonds in a molecule via electron density analysis. Moreover, in SISSA, I had a practice on rare events and enhanced sampling where I learned about physical ideas close to ones behind the TuTraSt. I was fascinated by the fusion of rigor and power in the idea of <<compensating>> the potential landscape of a system to make it better sample more extreme, aka rare regions of configurational space. Finally, the lab's tests for CH4 were conducted in LAMMPS, and it is mentioned that to speed up computations, authors want to translate the code from Matlab to Python and C++. I have been working in LAMMPS in my current project, and I consider myself proficient in all these three languages (see CV and git). So my computer skills will surely be relevant in this project if I was to work on it.

\lettersection{Laboratory for Multiscale Mechanics Modeling lammm}
Many recent lab's publications employ a molecular approach, so my experience will be relevant. Furthermore, I am looking forward to mastering multiscale methods. I am particularly interested in the projects on neural network potentials since they combine the best from both DFT and classical potential approaches. At MIPT I had a course <<ML in condensed matter physics>>, where I became acquainted with basic concepts on using NN potentials. My final project for the class was to find a reasonable and systematically improvable set of features and construct an ML potential for a crystal structure. In the end, I came up with an idea close to Moment Tensor Potentials. I believe there is a way to optimize and improve the methods currently used in the lab's research (e.g., 2017 article on NN). I am interested in implementing the concept of <<learning on the fly>>, which takes the balancing the DFT with potential dynamics even further than traditional NN potentials. Thus it achieves accuracy close to the pure DFT with orders of magnitude less computational time.

\lettersection{Theory and Simulation of Materials THEOS}
This lab has a list of Master's Projects, and they say those are adaptable for Bachelor Projects. At MIPT, I have already completed the first part of the Landau-Lifshitz course on quantum mechanics with 10/10 grade and will finish with the whole course by summer. Therefore I think by that time, I will be qualified to work on the adapted versions of offered masters projects since proper QM background is essential for most of them. Furthermore, having completed basic QM courses, I will be looking forward to mastering DFT and other computational QM techniques, and I believe THEOS lab to be a great place to do so. Besides QM, I have experience with Python and Jupyter, so I can work on the <<Visualization plugins for the Materials Cloud platform>> for which Python is the primary demand.
